          As a <span className="font-extrabold">developer</span>, I enjoy
          bridging the gap between engineering and design â€” combining my
          technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful

          efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user
          experiences.
